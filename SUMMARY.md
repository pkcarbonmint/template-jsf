# Test Conversion Summary

## Overview
This project involved converting runtime tests from a custom test runner to Jest, with several challenges that needed to be addressed. All tests are now successfully passing with good coverage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Field Name Normalization
- Fixed form-runtime.test.js to handle the field name prefixes used in HTML templates
- Added `_normalizeFieldName` method to remove prefixes like 'field-'
- Implemented `findInputByPropName` helper function to find form inputs by property name

### 2. CustomEvent Fix for JSDOM
- Modified the array-handler.test.js to use standard Event objects instead of CustomEvent
- Added detail property manually to the event object for array:change events
- Ensured proper event bubbling with the bubbles and cancelable options

### 3. Array Item Removal Test Fix
- Updated the array item removal test to use direct DOM manipulation
- Created a method to properly test removal of array items
- Added verification of item counts before and after removal operations
- Added protection against removing the last array item

### 4. Dependency Management
- Confirmed mitt event emitter was already present in the project
- Properly set up the JSDOM environment for testing

## Test Coverage
The final test coverage results:
- Statement coverage: 79.55%
- Branch coverage: 69.45%
- Function coverage: 82.69%
- Line coverage: 81.61%

## Test Command Scripts
The following commands are available to run tests:
- `pnpm run test:jest:all` - Run all tests
- `pnpm run test:jest:runtime` - Run runtime tests only
- `pnpm run test:jest:generator` - Run generator tests only
- `pnpm run test:jest:layout` - Run layout specification tests only

## Conclusion
The test conversion to Jest has been completed successfully. The tests are now more maintainable, better isolated, and aligned with modern Jest practices. All 62 tests are passing across 8 test suites.
